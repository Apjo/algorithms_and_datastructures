/*
This class is a simple demonstration for a heapsort to sort elements(integers in our case) in ascending order
This class assumes a couple of things:
1. The type of elements stored are only of Integers
2. This class is for demonstration purposes only, please use it as per your needs.
Heapsort:
1. insert n elements into the heap
2. if max heap perform extractMax n times, else extractMin operation n times
since time complexity of inserting a single element is O(log N), inserting n elements will be O(nlogn)
also, deleting an element takes O(logn) time, so deleting n elements will be O(nlogn)
hence combined together time complexity for heapsort will be: O(nlogn)
doing sorting in place? yes
stable?since all ops in heapsort they all involved swapping nodes with children, which means that sorting will not be stable,
initial ordering of equal keys will be unstable
