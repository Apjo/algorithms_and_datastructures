 * Wiki: <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_tree</a>

 * Helps in answering range queries. O(n) time to build, O(n) space, and O(log n) to answer a query.
 * An array [-1,3,4,0,2,1] will be represented as a segment tree as(ex: to find minimum between a given range):
 * Step 1 : Split the array into 2 halves, left half = [-1,3,4], and right half = [0,2,1], and continue splitting them
 * into halves
 * [-1, 3], [4], [0,2], [1]
 * Step 2: Once the leaves of the tree are decided we then recursively find the minimum between the elements and go up.
 * Finally, we end up having the minimum element at the root, which is the minimum between the entire range in our example
 * [0..5]. The `[]` around the integers in the tree represent the minimum element in that range
 *
 *                          -1[0, 5]
 *              /                                \
 *         -1[0, 2]                             0[3, 5]
 *        /       \                           /        \
 *    -1[0, 1]   4[2, 2]                0[3, 4]    1[5, 5]
 *   /            \                    /        \
 * -1[0, 0]        3[1,1]           0[3, 3]    2[4, 4]
 *
 * Step 3: Now, say we want to find the minimum element in the range [2..4], we need to remember 3 cases:
 * 1. Partial overlap of intervals: i.e. the given(requested) interval partially overlaps the known intervals.
 * In this case we look on both the sides of the tree
 * 2. No overlap: stop, and return a really large number
 * 3. Total overlap : stop, and return a really large number
 * BUILDING a Segment tree from an Array of Length N:
 * if N is even: the size of the array will be 2*N - 1
 * if N is odd:  Find the next power of 2, and then do 2*N - 1
 * We number the elements starting from 0(denoting the root of the binary tree)
 * To get the LEFT child: 2*i + 1
 * To get the RIGHT child: 2*i + 2
 * To get the PARENT: (i - 1) / 2
 * The size of this array in worst case will be atleast 4* size of the input array
