        Final Swap of Pivot with i + 1
After the for loop completes, all elements less than or equal to the pivot are to the left of index i.
The pivot element is still at the hi index, and all elements from i+1 to hi-1 are greater than the pivot.
To place the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array, you swap it with the element at i + 1.
This ensures that:
All elements to the left of i + 1 are less than or equal to the pivot.
The pivot is now at index i + 1.
All elements to the right of i + 1 are greater than the pivot.
This final swap ensures that the pivot is correctly positioned in the array, which is crucial for the recursive steps of the quicksort algorithm to work correctly.
